# Causation vs Correlation

### Difference between Correlation and Causation

Causation means one thing causes another—in other words, action A causes outcome B. On the other hand, correlation is simply a relationship where action A relates to action B—but one event doesn’t necessarily cause the other event to happen. For example, Spurious Correlations.

### Possibilities when A and B are Correlated
- A causes B
- B causes A
- A and B both are caused by C
- A does cause B, but only as long as D happens
- A causes E which in turn causes B

### Testing for Causation in your Product
Associating two variables as cause and effect without confirming causality could lead to a false positive - A causal relationship seems to exist but isn't actually there.

Two experiments or analysis to identify causation:
- Hypothesis Testing
- A/B/n experiments

### Hypothesis Testing
The most basic hypothesis test will involve an H0 (null hypothesis) and an H1 (your primary hypothesis). You can also have a secondary hypothesis, tertiary hypothesis, and so on.

The primary hypothesis points to the causal relationship you’re researching and should identify a cause (independent variable or exposure variable) and an effect (dependent variable or outcome variable).

To test this hypothesis, develop an equation that accurately reflects the relationship between your expected cause (independent or exposure variable) and effect (dependent or outcome variable). If your model allows you to plug in a value for your exposure variable and consistently return an outcome that reflects actual observed data, you are probably onto something.

Could involve a Longitudinal Study (Researchers repeatedly examine the same individuals to detect any changes that might occur over a period of time) or a Cross-Sectional Study (Researchers examine different samples of a population at one point in time)

### A/B/n Experimentation
Look at each of your variables, change one so you have different versions (variant A and variant B), and see what happens. If your outcome consistently changes (with the same trend), you’ve found the variable that makes the difference.

A/B/n is ideal when comparing the impact of different variations—variant A and variant B—for campaigns, product features, content strategies, and more.
